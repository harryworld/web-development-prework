## Warning: Installation

__Do not__ try to install major developer tools (Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, Meteor, CoffeeScript, etc.) until the class starts.

In the course of this prework we will suggest some applications: you can already install those - and only those - and get familiar with them.

__Bad installs can cause time-consuming problems__.  If youâ€™ve already setup your development environment, we recommend making a backup of your settings.

At the start of the course, we will have time to install and configure your development environment.
