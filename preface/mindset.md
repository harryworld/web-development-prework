## Mindset

Learning anything successfully requires a good mindset. Here are a few things to watch out for:

#### There is no magic in learning.

At least no magic until the day we can transfer knowledge, _a la Matrix_, by plugging in a chip into your brain. For now, you get what you put into the course.

#### No one knows everything.

That includes your instructors. We are not high and mighty. What we do have are experience and skill sets to help us figure things out. These are things we are eager to share and impart with you. Remember that your learning process only begins with this course: being a developer requires continuous learning!

#### More important than knowledge: the ability to learn

We'll teach you languages, techniques, good habits... but most importantly we will teach you how to learn. You will learn where to find the right information and how to learn the newest technologies by yourself. We hope that you will (re)discover that satisfaction and passion of learning!

#### There are many ways to solve a problem.

The saying goes, _"There are many was to skin a cat."_ There is little reason to become dogmatic to any approach. So, keep an open mind and expose yourself to different ways people approach problems. It will help you grow much quicker as a developer.

#### Learn by doing

There is no such thing as practice. Nothing will teach you more than your own experience, so be curious, test things, try, fail, try again, as many times as necessary!

#### Development is an art; be an artisan.

Coding is a craft. Like a good writer, caring about what and how you write differentiates the great from the mediocre.
